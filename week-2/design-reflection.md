*What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
  - Information gathering(knowing what the site is going to be used for)
  - planning(site map showing what leads to where)
  - design(deciding the look of the site, colors, fonts, etc)
  - development(adding html/css to make the site)
  - testing/delivery(making sure the site works cross platform, finding bugs, and submitting a finished product)
  - maintenance(updating and upkeeping)

*What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
  -a professional website used to display information about me for potential employers

*What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  -The target audience's interests should be trying to find a potential employee with both technical skill and interest in current tech trends. The "projects" page will show what I've worked on, giving an example of my ability as a developer. The "blog" page will be used to show personal thoughts and interests in current tech.

*What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
  -The primary action should be to view my portfolio and contact me if they develop enough interest.

*What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  -it's subjective. design around the user and ask questions like whether the site is easy to use, or how efficient it is.

*What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
  -UX design is designing a website in a way that makes it so the user will be willing to return to the site by making it easy to use, efficient, visually appealing, etc.

*Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  -Trying to describe something that's subjective. It's like describing what makes something like "art" successful.
