<!--
**What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?**
  -it was fun. not a new experience, but fun.

**How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?**
  -both frustrating and rewarding

**How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)**
  -it was weird because I accidentally read through styling so I really wanted to style things

**What seems good and bad about HTML?**
  -it's simple. maybe too simple to the point where you can easily make mistakes and not notice them or be tempted to do certain things (like styling) when there are better ways to do it

**What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?**
  -i don't have tricks. i find that it's simple enough to remember that you just need to get used to what tags mean and you'll be fine.
