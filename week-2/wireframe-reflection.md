## What is a wireframe?
  - a wire frame is a visual representation of the website layout

## What are the benefits of wireframing?
  - it helps you plan out what you need in html when building a site and helps you get a sense of balance in your design vs content

## Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
  - once I got into it, sure. It's interesting to have that sense of curiosity of thinking about what you can do while trying to keep it a certain way.

## Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
  - i revised it. I'll probably revise it again at some point as I learn more.

## What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
  - How can I make this look better? Simpler, yet still convey what I need? I didn't really look into finding any answers, so I'm still not sure if the wireframe looks better than before.

## Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
  - I enjoyed the thoughts of figuring out what I wanted while trying to keep things seemingly simple. The most tedious part was putting the wireframe together only because I did it on mockingbird instead of doing it on pen and paper.
