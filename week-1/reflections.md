# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

*Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

The biggest ideas that stuck out to me were the pomodoro technique, creating small habits to supplement big change, that allowing for times of little to no productivity can help being productive, and that you can use actions to drive the mind rather than the other way around.

*What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

Time boxing is setting a specific time limit for doing something. Rather than evaluating the time it takes to finish something, it's evaluating how much was done within a given time. This can be used in Phase 0 to help motivate you to learning more in a shorter amount of time than it would be to try to learn things all in one go which may end up resulting in not learning or understanding as much as you could have.

*How do you manage your time currently?

Currently I try to set up a time to start and simply try to get things done.

*Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

It's not working as well as I think it could. While choosing a start time isn't hard, it's the idea of just going through material until I'm "finished" that gives me problems. Not having a defined finish time means I go for "as long as I need to" which ends up making me less productive than I want to be.

*Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?

Of course. I'll mostly try to do the Pomodoro technique in conjunction with the tiny habits. By giving myself a limit, I can feel a sense of urgency to be productive within defined terms instead of "just doing it". The short breaks can then be used as a sort of reward to the working time and the processes together can be thought of overall as a "small habit", maybe even to create other good tiny habits during "reward time".

*What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

My plan for time management is to treat it as if I was on-site, that is, setting a start and end time to commit to class work. Within those times, break it up via Pomodoro technique, allowing for defined times of productivity and defined times for breaks. Then using that system as a trigger to build a habit in order to build up a constantly productive work flow.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

*What is a shell? What is "bash?"

a shell is the user interface for accessing an operating system's services, using either a command line interface (lines of code/commands) or a graphical user interface (icons). Bash is a unix shell and command language used in many of today's electronics.

*What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

memorizing commands, realizing when or where you can use the commands

*Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

yes

*In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

pwd, ls, mv, ../, touch, mkdir, rmdir, less, -help

*Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

  -pwd = print working directory = shows where you are in the shell

  -ls = list = shows files and directories in your current directory

  -mv = move = it basically renames the file

  -cd = change directory = changes your working directory to the path you specify

  -../ = dot dot = change to parent directory of current directory. move up a directory

  -touch = create an empty file in the current directory

  -mkdir = make directory = similar to touch except creates a directory/"folder"

  -less = makes it so files with many lines can be viewed in chunks or "pages"

  -rmdir = remove directory = deletes specified directory if nothing is inside it

  -rm = remove = deletes specified file(s) within directory

  -help = shows information on the specified command

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

*If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be?

##### to create a new repo

1. go to github.com and sign in/up.

2. click the "+" in the top right corner next to your github avatar

3. click new repository

4. you will be taken to the new repo page. do the following:

  -name it something relevant.

  -make sure it's "public".

  -change the license to MIT License.

  -then click create repository.

##### to fork a repo

1. navigate to the repo you wish to fork.

2. click the "fork" button around the top right of the page.

this will copy the repo to your own github account

##### to clone a repo

1. copy the clone url in the bottom right of the repo page.

2. on your command line, type "git clone" and paste the clone url of the repo and press enter.

this will copy the repo to your machine

 Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

forking allows you to copy all the files in a repo with a simple click. if you created a new repo, you'd have to also create the files.

*What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

I didn't really struggle with it. it was pretty straight forward in my opinion.

I learned how easy it was to fork and clone repo's.
