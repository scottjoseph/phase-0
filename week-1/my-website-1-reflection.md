*Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.
  https://scottjoseph.github.io/

*Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
  1. go to github.com in your internet browser and sign in or create an account
  2. click on the "+" in the top right corner of the page.
  3. click on "new repository"
  4. name your repository in the "repository name" field.
  5. choose whether you want the repository to be public (anyone can see it) or private (you can choose who sees it)
  6. check "initialize this repository with a README" if this is a new repository. skip if you want to clone an existing repository.
  7. change the "add a license: none" drop box to MIT License
  8. click create repository
  9. if you want to clone an existing repository,first go to that repository.
  10. copy the clone url on the bottom right of the repository page
  11. open your terminal
  12. type "git clone" followed by the URL you copied (should look like "git clone git@github.com:blahblahblah") and press enter

*Describe what open source means.
  open source means that the user has access to the source code of a program and can alter it however they want.

*What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  I think open source is cool. as developing things is mostly a team based activity, having open source content means various things can be made or improved at a much faster rate. normally, open source doesn't bother me unless someone else is receiving credit for something I've done. to be able to find resources that are free is always nice, not sure I'd call it a utopia though.

*Assess the importance of using licenses.
  it's important to have different licenses so you know what you can or can't do with whatever material or resource you're trying to access. otherwise anyone could claim others work as their own.

*What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  knowing how to make and cloning repositories is pretty solid. the only "aha" moment I had was making sure I wasn't in the wrong directory. I didn't really struggle with this challenge, I actually got to the reflection pretty fast.

*Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  I did a simple google search about licenses but nothing specific.
